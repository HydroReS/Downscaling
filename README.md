# Downscaling
Functions to statistical downscale daily precipitation and temperature. The downscaling procedure is based on a mixed CDF matching approach.

# Precipitation
Daily precipitation was modelled using a mixed distribution of Lognormal distribution in the center and Generalized Pareto distribution for
the extremes, i.e., distribution tails (Emmanouil et. al., 2021; Mamalakis et. al., 2017).

# Temperature
Daily temperature was modelled using a mixed distribution of Gaussian distribution in the center and Generalized Pareto on both lower
and upper tail.
